# This file should contain the locations and cabinets in Sunbird 
# that you would like to compare to your GLPI inventory. 

# Some Data Center and Room names cannot be automatically parsed from Sunbird,
# so you can optionally provide explicit definitions for Data Center and Room for each
# Location. This is meant primarily for use with the create_glpi_computer_redfish.py
# script.

# Leave Cabinets: blank to search across all cabinets in that location.
